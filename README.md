A collected resource for scRNA-seq data analysis with biomedical applications
It is challenging for biomedical researchers without bioinformatics background 
to understand every detail in scRNA-seq data analysis and conduct data analysis 
for their own samples. For instance, scRNA-seq data analysis requires 
installation of specific software tools and running through the scripts written 
with programming languages such as R and Python.
